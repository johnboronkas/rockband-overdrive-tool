# Rock Band Overdrive Tool (rBot)
Pass in a path to a song file, returns the optimal overdrive path in a file.

Pass in a band option flag and some unique song files (up to 1 per instrument) to return the optimal band overdrive path (can just be bass and vox for example).

## Contributing
Right now, we need song files for all instruments on Centuries by Fall Out Boy.

We also need details of how each instrument scores points (especailly drums/guitar), collects overdrive, activates it, etc. Anything you can get. There is a wiki page for each.

If you're a programmer, help is always welcomed with the algorithm.

Finally, we also need "dry" FC's for each instrument on Centuries. Dry meaning no overdrive activations. This is to get a baseline for our scoring and make sure our algorithm is calculating the scores correctly.
